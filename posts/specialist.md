## About
I started this project for fun back in 2020 because I was interested in the concept of Discord bots. The original idea was to make a bot to instantly recreate [the Persona 4 Dancing Specialist meme](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTczCpIaLAU) (because it was popular at the time). Eventually, the idea spiralled into a YouTube clip maker, a community-curated soundboard with "parry" mechanics, and a YouTube video player. Basically, it was my pet project where I put in whatever I wanted.

It was utilized in my friend group's private server until that server's discontinuation in late 2021. In early 2022, I thought it would be a good idea to make the code public, as it would be a good portfolio piece. I then released it under the MIT license on January 3rd, 2022.
