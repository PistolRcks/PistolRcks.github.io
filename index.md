I'm Peter Arnold, a senior Computer Science -- Cybersecurity Focus student studying at the University of Wisconsin - Stout. I've been coding as a hobby since around 2015, and have been studying Computer Science at UW-Stout since 2020. 

As a "hobbyist [of] a lot of things, actually," I enjoy trying out new things and dabbling in other areas of creativity. I've done 2D and 3D digital art, audio and video editing, animation, and physical propmaking, some of which can be seen in this portfolio.
